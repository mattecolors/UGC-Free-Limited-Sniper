# UGC-Free-Limited-Sniper
Directions for the script are in the README file. This does not require sending your .ROBLOSECURITY file as anything that asks for it is probably malicious and trying to scam you. This is one of the few real ones.


**DIRECTIONS:**

1. Go to the item you want to get (preferrably on a free UGC item)
2. Open the Developer Console (CTRL + SHIFT + I)
3. Find the "Console" setting in the Developer Console

**YOU SHOULD SEE A BIG WARNING SIGN THAT SAYS STOP, IF YOU DO, YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE**

4. Take the code that I have provided and paste it in the Console
5. If it is done right, it should reload the page if the item is NOT for sale and auto-buy the item if it IS for sale (more changes to this will be coming soon).

**EXTRA:**

Everytime the page reloads or you have successfully bought the item, you WILL have to paste the code in the Console again.

If it says Invalid Argument, reload the page and paste the code in again

ONCE AGAIN, THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE TAKING YOUR .ROBLOSECURITY FILE, IF SOMEONE ASKS FOR IT, DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM, IT GIVES THEM YOUR COOKIES AND ALLOWS THEM TO LOGIN INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.
